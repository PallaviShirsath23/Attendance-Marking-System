# Attendance-Marking-System:
Attendance Marking System is a facial recognition-based solution for automating attendance tracking. This system utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and pandas for face detection, recognition, and attendance logging.

# Overview:
The system captures video from a camera, detects faces, and matches them to pre-trained images to mark attendance. The attendance data, including the person's name, timestamp, and update count, is logged into an Excel file.

# Features:
• Face detection and recognition
• Attendance logging
• Update count for each individual
• Real-time face matching and marking

# Pre-requisites:
• Python 3
• OpenCV
• NumPy
• python pandas

# Usage:
1. Prepare face data: Organize individual face images into folders.
2. Train the face recognition model: python faceRegistration.py
3. Run the attendance marking system: python attendance01.py
4. The system will start capturing video, recognizing faces, and logging attendance.
